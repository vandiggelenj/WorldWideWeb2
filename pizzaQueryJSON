Missouri is not known for its Pizza. I only get there Pizza because I live across the street from them so its easy for me. Last 4 times I ordered a Pizza from them I almost threw up! esp there white crust, I would to take the owner to Ginos pizza in chicago or to .adriennes pizza bar in Brooklyn to compare. Then he can tasts what good pizza is! I will never waste my hard earned money on what they call pizza. His customers are college students down town and kids in the west side. I need a real pizzeria not an upgrade chucky cheese pizza, any suggestions?"

It looks like a dungeon, with dim lights, walls literally painted dark green and red, and uncomfortable furniture crammed into a tiny space. The entire restaurant smells faintly of urine, particularly in the bathrooms. The employees, at least on the days Ive gone there, have had long hair (w/ no hair nets) lots of tattoos and piercings. I dont judge peoples appearance personally, but as food preparers they look like they have all the qualities needed to spread the Hep C virus. In short, if you love the pizza, which ironically is very good, and you dont mind dark, morose, cramped spaces, a constant urine scent, or dirty-looking people, then get yourself some Gumbys. Its good grub. Otherwise, go somewhere else."
